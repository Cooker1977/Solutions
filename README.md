# Solutions
This is a personal project to save the code I used to solve programming problems, math problems, and
experiment with algorithms. It currently contains my Project Euler solutions and my solutions to the
Stanford machine learning course exercises.

The machine learning solutions should all give the correct solutions, but some of the charting didn't
work correctly. I think this was due to my octave version or environment.
