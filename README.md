# Solutions
This is a personal project to save the code I used to solve programming problems, math problems, and
experiment with algorithms. It currently contains my Project Euler solutions. I plan to add the 
Stanford machine learning class solutions at some point, but I would like to translate them out 
of octave and into a .NET language.
